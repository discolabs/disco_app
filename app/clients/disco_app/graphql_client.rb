require 'rest-client'

##
# This file defines a very simple GraphQL API client to support a single type
# of GraphQL API call for a Shopify store - sending a Shopify Flow trigger.
#
# We use this simple approach rather than using an existing GraphQL client
# library such as https://github.com/github/graphql-client (either standalone
# or as bundled with the Shopify API gem) for a couple of reasons:
#
#   - These libraries tend to presume that a single client instance is
#     instantiated once and then reused across the application, which isn't the
#     case when we're making API calls once per trigger for each background
#     job.
#   - These libraries make an API call to fetch the Shopify GraphQL schema on
#     initialisation. The schema is very large, so the API call takes a number
#     of seconds to complete and when parsed consumes a large amount of memory.
#   - These libraries do not natively work well with the idea of a dynamic API
#     endpoint (ie, changing the request URL frequently), which is required
#     when making many requests to different Shopify stores.
