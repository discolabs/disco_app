# DiscoApp Rails Engine
A Rails Engine encapsulating common functionality for Disco's Shopify
applications.

Aims to make it a cinch to get a new Shopify application up and running, as
well as providing common functionality in a single codebase.

## Getting Started
Spinning up a new Shopify app with this engine is a simple four-step process,
detailed below.


### 1. Setting up
First make sure you've got all of the tools you need for Shopify and Rails
development. You should read through the [General Development][] and
[Rails Development][] sections on the Disco documentation site. The key things
to note are:

- You should have set up a Shopify Partner account to allow you to create
  development stores and applications;
- [rbenv][] is recommended for Ruby version management;
- You should have the latest version of Ruby 2.2 installed locally, along with
  the `rails` and `bundler` gems;
- You should have some form of HTTP tunnelling software like [ngrok][] or
  [localtunnel][] installed.

### 2. Creating the Rails app
Running the following commands from your terminal to create a new Rails app,
add the DiscoApp Rails Engine to your Gemfile, and set up the Engine:

```
$ export DISCO_GEM_CREDENTIALS=disco-gems:f361b0fef05c465c85a3d2d297930719617cb583
$ rails new example_app
$ cd example_app
$ echo "gem 'disco_app', git: 'https://$DISCO_GEM_CREDENTIALS@github.com/discolabs/disco_app.git', tag: '0.5.6'" >> Gemfile
$ bundle update
$ bundle exec rails generate disco_app --force
$ bundle install
```

Note the `tag` option being added to the Gemfile - this pins the version of
DiscoApp you'll be using and avoid accidentally pulling incompatible changes
into your project when you run a `bundle update`. Double check that the tag
number you're using is the latest version available.

Once this is complete, you'll have a new Rails app created in `/example_app`,
with the DiscoApp Engine configured and mounted.

There are some additional "optional" generators that you can run to add
additional functionality or features to the application. See the section
[Optional Generators][] for more.
  
[Optional Generators]: #optional-generators

### 3. Setting up the Shopify app
In order to work on our app, we need to create a development application from
the Shopify Partners dashboard. Once that's done, we can copy across the
generated API credentials to our development app and perform a test install.

To do this, open your Shopify Partner dashboard and create a new application
from the "Apps" tab. Make sure the "Embedded App" option is selected. When
prompted for the **Application URL**, enter the endpoint provided by your
tunneling software - for example, `https://example.ngrok.io`. You can ignore the
fields for **Preferences URL** and **Support URL** for now. The 
**Redirection URL** should be set to something like
`https://example.ngrok.io/auth/shopify/callback`.

Once the application has been created on Shopify, copy over the API credentials
to the `SHOPIFY_APP_API_KEY` and `SHOPIFY_APP_SECRET` values in the `.env` file
located in the root directory of the Rails app (this file was created by the
DiscoApp generator during step 2).

While the `.env` file is open, add in values for `DEFAULT_HOST` (this should be
the tunnel endpoint), `SHOPIFY_APP_NAME`, `SHOPIFY_APP_REDIRECT_URI`, and
`SHOPIFY_APP_SCOPE` (view a [list of scopes][]). The `SHOPIFY_CHARGES_REAL`,
`SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `REDIS_PROVIDER` values can be left blank in development.

When you're done, your `.env` file should look something like this:

```
DEFAULT_HOST=https://example.ngrok.io

SHOPIFY_APP_NAME=Example App
SHOPIFY_APP_API_KEY=ebef81bcfe2174ff2c6e65f5c0a0ba50
SHOPIFY_APP_SECRET=d5e1347de6352cb778413654e1296dde
SHOPIFY_APP_REDIRECT_URI=https://example.ngrok.io/auth/shopify/callback
SHOPIFY_APP_SCOPE=read_products,write_script_tags

SHOPIFY_CHARGES_REAL=

SECRET_KEY_BASE=

REDIS_PROVIDER=
```

[list of scopes]: https://docs.shopify.com/api/authentication/oauth#scopes

### 4. Putting it all together
Finally, we're ready to test the installation of the development app. First,
fire up your tunneling software to proxy requests to port 3000 on your local
machine. For example, if using ngrok:

```
$ ngrok http -subdomain=example 3000
```

In another terminal window, start up the Rails webserver. The DiscoApp
generator provides a Rake task to easily start the server:

```
$ rake start
```

Now you should be able to visit the root URL of your app in the browser (eg
`https://example.ngrok.io`) and be presented with the login screen. Enter the
name of a development Shopify store, and you should be taken through the
process of authorising and installing the application to the store.

If you don't have a development store to test with, you can create one from the
Shopify Partner dashboard in a similar manner to creating a development app.

***Note:*** It's important to access your local development app via SSL (ie,
`https://example.ngrok.io` rather than `http://example.ngrok.io`. Otherwise,
the URLs generated during the OAuth flow won't match your application settings
and you won't be able to install the app.


## Engine Overview
The DiscoApp Rails Engine incorporates and extends the functionality provided
by the ShopifyApp Rails Engine, which is an official gem developed by Shopify.

### Environment and Configuration
The following gems are added during setup:

- [shopify_app][] for basic Shopify application functionality;
- [puma][] for serving the app in development and production;
- [sidekiq][] for background job processing in production;
- [pg][] for Postgres use in production;
- [dotenv-rails][] for reading environment variables from `.env` files in
  development;
- [rails_12factor][] for use with Heroku/Dokku in production.

The following configuration changes are made:

- Force SSL in production;
- Use Sidekiq as the `ActiveJob` queue adapter in production;
- Set the default host in the router to allow absolute URL reversal.

Finally, the following environment changes are made:

- Add `.ruby-version` file and update Gemfile to lock down Ruby version being
  used;
- Add default `.env` and `.env.sample` files for development environment
  management;
- Add a `Procfile` for deployment to Heroku;
- Update the `.gitignore` with some additional useful defaults;
- Add a `start` Rake tasks to spin up Puma in development.

### Authentication, Sessions and the Shop Model
The functionality provided by the ShopifyApp engine includes support for OAuth
authentication and storing session information in a `Shop` model. The gem also
provides a `SessionsController` which is used to log in and authenticate with
Shopify.

During installation and setup, a `DiscoApp::Shop` model is created, which stores
the domain name and API token for a shop that installs the app, along with a
number of other attributes such as email address, country, Shopify plan type,
et cetera.

### Charge and Installation Checks
The gem provides a `DiscoApp::AuthenticatedController` concern that should be
included into any controller that handles actions inside the embedded admin
panel. The concern performs the following checks:

- Checks the shop has an authenticated session. If not, redirects to the OAuth
  authentication flow provided by the `ShopifyApp` gem;
- Checks the current shop has successfully authorised any relevant charge for
  the use of the application. If not, redirects to a charge creation and
  authorisation flow (provided by `DiscoApp::ChargesController`);
- Checks the app has completed installation for the current shop. If not,
  begins the installation and displays an "Installing..." progress page until
  installation is complete (provided by `DiscoApp::InstallController`).

### Background Tasks
The `DiscoApp::ShopJob` class inherits from `ActiveJob::Base`, and can be used
to queue jobs that need to take place in the API context of a particular shop.
This means that inside the `perform` method of a `ShopJob`, all API calls will
automatically be made on behalf of the shop, like so:

```
class FindAllProductsJob < DiscoApp::ShopJob
  def perform(domain)
    ShopifyAPI::Product.find(:all)
  end
end
```

Note that the first argument of the `perform` method on a `ShopJob` *must
always* be the Shopify domain of the context shop (eg `example.myshopify.com`).

During the setup process, DiscoApp creates some default jobs that are queued
during installation or after specific webhooks are received. They are:

- `DiscoApp::AppInstalledJob`, triggered when the application is installed. By
  default, this job uses the Shopify API to set up webhooks and to perform
  initial data synchronisation.
- `DiscoApp::AppUninstalledJob`, triggered when the `app/uninstalled` webhook is
  received. By default, this job simply updates the `status` flag on the
  `DiscoApp::Shop` model, but you may wish to add tasks like sending a
  cancellation email or the like.
- `DiscoApp::ShopUpdateJob`, triggered when the `shop/update` webhook is
  received. By default, this task keeps the metadata attributes on the relevant
  `DiscoApp::Shop` model up to date.

The default jobs that come with the engine can be extended through the use of
Concerns in a similar way to the models that come with the engine. See
[Extending Models][] below.

[Extending Models]: #extending-models

### Webhooks
As you may have noticed from the preceding section, webhooks and background
tasks are closely linked. The DiscoApp Engine routes requests to `/webhooks`
to the `process_webhook` method on `DiscoApp::WebhooksController`.

When the controller receives an inbound webhook, it is automatically verified
using the application's secret key. The controller then attempt to queue a job
matching the topic name of the incoming webhook (eg `app/uninstalled` will try
to queue a job named `DiscoApp::AppUninstalledJob`). Two arguments will be
passed to the job's `perform` method: the domain of the shop the webhook was
related to, and the JSON payload of the webhook as a hash.

There shouldn't be any need to extend or override `DiscoApp::WebhooksController`
inside an application - all application logic should simply be placed inside the
relevant `*Job` class.

Webhooks should generally be created inside the `perform` method of the
`DiscoApp::AppInstalledJob` background task. By default, webhooks are set up to
listen for the `app/uninstalled` and `shop/update` webhook topics.

### Application Proxies
The gem provides support for Shopify's [Application Proxy][] functionality
through a controller concern named `DiscoApp::AppProxyController`. Including
this concern on any controller will automatically verify each incoming request
to make sure it's coming from Shopify (see the [security section][]) in the
Shopify documentation. Note that by default this check is only performed in
production environments.

The `DiscoApp::AppProxyController` also alters the response headers to return
an `application/liquid` MIME type by default, to allow the processing of Liquid
by Shopify before returning the response to the user. If you'd like to return
plain HTML and avoid Liquid processing, you can add a `skip_after_action`
directive on your controller targeting the `:add_liquid_header` method.

Here's an example controller using the concern, that will return plain HTML
from its `index` action and Liquid from its `show` action:

```ruby
class MarblesController < ApplicationController
  include DiscoApp::AppProxyController
  
  skip_after_action :add_liquid_header, only: [:index]
  
  def index
    @marbles = Marble.all
  end
  
  def show
    @marble = Marble.find(params[:id])
  end  
end  
```

Note that in this instance it's important that `ApplicationController` doesn't
perform any login authentication, as no session information is made available
in proxied requests.

[security section]: https://docs.shopify.com/api/uiintegrations/application-proxies#security

### Extending Models
The models that come with the `DiscoApp` engine (such as `DiscoApp::Shop`) can
be extended through the use of Rails Concerns (see [Overriding Models][] in the
official Rails Guides for an idea how this works).

Here's the example used inside the "dummy" app used for testing the engine:

```ruby
require 'active_utils'

class DiscoApp::Shop < ActiveRecord::Base
  include DiscoApp::Concerns::Shop

  # Extend the Shop model to return the Shop's country as an ActiveUtils country.
  def country
    begin
      ActiveUtils::Country.find(country_name)
    rescue ActiveUtils::InvalidCountryCodeError
      nil
    end
  end

end
```

## Optional Generators
A number of "optional" generators are provided to add functionality that's
useful, but not necessary for every application. They should be run after
you've completed the "Creating the Rails app" step described in the "Getting
Started" section above.

These generators are provided as conveniences. You should still carefully check
the changes they make to your app after running them to tidy up their changes.

A list of available optional generators follows.

### Reactify
```
$ bundle exec rails generate disco_app:reactify
```

Adds the `react-rails` gem and installs and configures React.js for use with
the Rails application.

### Mailify
```
$ bundle exec rails generate disco_app:mailify
```

Adds the `mailgun_rails` and `premailer-rails` gems and configures Active Mailer
to use the Mailgun API in production for sending email. Adds the
`MAILGUN_API_KEY` and `MAILGUN_API_DOMAIN` environment variables.
